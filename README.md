GIT: an open source program that is used to track changes in text files.

GITHUB: internet based version control system.

Repository: contains all of the user's project files and stores their revision history.

Clone: copy of the repository that is located in your computer instead of the website's server.

Commit: saving the changes that were made to your file that usually includes a unique message to let the user know what was changed.

Push: sending your saved changes to a remote repository.

Pull: fetching in changes and then merging them so that those changes are updated in your repository as well as your local device.

Branch: a version of your repository that is not affected by the master branch.

Merge: applies changes from one branch to another that often occurs when the user is trying to do a git pull command.

Merge Conflict: occurs when Git fails to choose which changes are supposed to be included when you do a merge command. 

Fetch: getting your updated changes from an online repository without merging them.

Remote: a version whose host is a server, which can be connected to local clones.
